                    <td>
                        When the "universal lotteries" said that adcock has won 
                        the ultra-super global special, the top "prize", she sets 
                        the tone of the poem, making it become sort of unexpected. 
                        This is a metaphor because it is not actually a prize. Here 
                        in this instance, the prize represents the experience to be able 
                        to win a lottery. an experience to give "way to" her "emotion" . 
                        Adcock used this metaphor beacause experience is valuable and desired, 
                        much like prizes. she also used the word "top" to even further 
                        demonstrate the value of the prize. The "prize" in the poem is the 
                        million pounds that she is about to recieve. But here, the people 
                        at universal lotteries creates a sarcastic joke, by putting, "Or, 
                        actually with more than a million-. Universal Lotteries also mocked 
                        Adcock's innocence by adding"not that it makes a lot of difference 
                        once your a millionaire." thereafter, "they laughed." Here, the poet 
                        gives us a hint that the prize is fake, as an extra million is 
                        actually a major difference in real life.

                        The poet compared “the top of her head” to “a flying saucer”. 
                        Literally, a “flying saucer” is a plate traveling through the air, 
                        but metaphorically it refers to the mixed emotions the person felt 
                        at the time. First, she was obviously excited about winning a 
                        lottery, but at the same time felt unbelievable that she was so lucky. 
                        Greed developed in her mind and made her lost in the illusion of winning 
                        a million pounds. She was also confused because she “haven’t bought a 
                        lottery ticket for years and years.” This also supports her thought that 
                        this was impossible. The image of a “flying saucer” presents the excitement, 
                        greed and confusion that the person experienced after hearing she had won the prize.

                        Literally, the “lottery ticket” refers to the ticket information 
                        that Universal Lotteries bought up, which was then fed into the 
                        computer to “see who the lucky person is.” MEtaphorically, the 
                        lottery ticket that the person bought “years and years ago” is a 
                        chance for her to win a lottery. Even if she didn’t win an actual 
                        tangible prize, the experience of winning a million pounds is also 
                        valuable. Therefore symbolically, the lottery ticket connotes the 
                        opportunity to gain a special experience, such as winning a lottery. 
                        Even a ticket bought a long time ago can provide an opportunity to 
                        win an experience as the prize, so things you’ve done a long time 
                        ago may be a passage to something unique in the future. Without 
                        buying the ticket, the chance of winning the lottery is 0%. To 
                        summarize, the lottery ticket symbolizes the opportunity to gain 
                        a remarkable experience.

                    <p class="fs-5">
                        The poem is about how emotions 
                        could greatly affect oneself, and could even momentarily affect your view of reality, 
                        since it took a while for Adcock to realise that this all could be fake, and "universal 
                        lotteries were just lying". She also demonstrates our human fascination with luck, and 
                        how we- at least once in our life, have wasted money on lottery tickets, hoping to 
                        win some sort of prize. Adcock also named the poem "<strong><mark>The</mark></strong> 
                        Telephone Call", and not "<strong><mark>A</mark></strong> Telephone Call" This is probably 
                        because she had an experience similar to this within her life, and the experience might have 
                        been memorable, or have possibly changed her life. She also used humor to keep the reader of 
                        the poem reading to the end.
