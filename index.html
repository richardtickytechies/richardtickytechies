                The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə ˈliːsə/; italian: La Gioconda [la dʒoˈkonda] or Monna
                Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]) is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist 
                Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,
                [4][5] it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written
                about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".[6]
                The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,
                [7] the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms,
                and the atmospheric illusionism.[8]

                Girl with a Pearl Earring (Dutch: Meisje met de parel)[1][2] is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[3] The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.[4]
